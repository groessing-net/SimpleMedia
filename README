SimpleMedia is a media and image module. It is developed for Zikula 1.3.x

The basic module is generated with MOST (http://modulestudio.de/) by Guite (Axel) and only for the latest Zikula >= 1.3.x.
Further development of the code and templates is ongoing.

See for more information the wiki page: https://github.com/zikula-ev/SimpleMedia/wiki

Code is being converted to ModuleStudio 0.6.1 at the moment, and is not stable and completed yet :-( Hang on.
