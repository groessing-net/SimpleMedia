SimpleMedia 2
=============
SimpleMedia is file and media management in Collections.
This module is intended for being used with Zikula 1.3.5 and 1.3.6.

The basic module is generated with MOST (http://modulestudio.de/) by Guite (Axel) and only for the latest Zikula >= 1.3.x.
Further development of the code and templates is ongoing.

See for more information the wiki page: https://github.com/zikula-ev/SimpleMedia/wiki

==> Code is being converted to ModuleStudio 0.6.1 at the moment, and is not stable and completed yet :-( Hang on.

Templates are being developed by first putting them in /config with a template_override and after being final they will 
go in the module templates folder. So during development the contents of the config folder needs to be copied to /config.
template_overrides_sm2.yml serves as example template_overrides to use for this.
